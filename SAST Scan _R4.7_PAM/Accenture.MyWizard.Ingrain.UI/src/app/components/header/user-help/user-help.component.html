        <p><strong>Monitoring.</strong> As permitted by applicable law, Accenture reserves the right to monitor
          activity
          on its myWizard. Such monitoring may include a review of the volumes and frequency of materials being
          uploaded
          or downloaded, and a review of the content reported as inappropriate by other employees. Should it be
          determined
          that the volume of uploading or downloading substantially exceeds that of the average user, then there may
          be
          a
          further review of the nature and substance of the content and its relation to the role of the employee and
          myWizard user. </p>

        <p>If you see content on Accenture's myWizard that violates Accenture Policies or our COBE, please report it
          via
          a
          provided flagging mechanism on the specific platform if it exists, or to your supervisor, career counselor,
          anyone in Accenture Leadership, Legal or Human Resources. If you are uncomfortable using any of these
          channels,
          please seek additional direction on how to report violations from <strong><a class="footer-link"
              href="https://policies.accenture.com/Pages/0901-1000/1000.aspx" target="_blank">Policy 1000 - Raising

              and Ethics Issues and Prohibiting Retaliation.</a></strong> </p>

        <p><strong>Consequences.</strong> . Violations of Accenture Policies or these Terms of Use may result in
          appropriate, lawful discipline, up to and including termination of employment. Additionally, for
          non-employees,
          Accenture may choose to sever its relationship or revoke the credentials of the user for violations of these
          Terms of Use. No provision of these Terms of Use, however, shall be interpreted or applied in a manner that
          would interfere with any employee rights that are protected by applicable laws or regulations.</p>
